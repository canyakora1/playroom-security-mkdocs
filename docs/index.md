## Python for Cybersecurity

Hey there, The Cybersecurity space is vastly characterized by dtecting threats,  leveling cybersecurity tools technique and processes in mitigating and strengthening network, applications and The Enterprise as a whole. 

I created this repository as a resource or guide for those who are new to Python and want to learn it for Cybersecurity both from the blue side and also Red teaming.

However, I'd like to emphasise that using you cannot become a Python expert in 7 days, and this repository does not automatically turn you into a Python expert. It is only a starting point for you to gain a basic understanding of the language and some related concepts.

Python is a vast and ever-changing language, and becoming an expert takes time and practise.
I hope this disclaimer clears up any misunderstandings and assists you in approaching this resource with realistic expectations. Happy studying!
